## Oh, hey!

I'm Sam (also known as Sammu), and I'm a programmer/developer that specializes in video game work, but I also like working on software & application development.

Most of my repositories are private, but my primary programming expertise is in C#, GML, and Java. My largest publicly documented projects are my Super Mario Bros. & Super Mario World remakes made in GameMaker Studio 2. You can see them here:
